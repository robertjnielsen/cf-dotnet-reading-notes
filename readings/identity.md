# Identity

## What Is Identity?

ASP.NET Core Identity is a system that allows user login / accounts in an ASP.NET Core web application.

Identity is a .NET Core API library that enables and configures user Authentication (Auth/n) and Authorization (Auth/z).

Authentication is simply **who the user is**. This means that we can verify the identity of the user and determine if they are who they say they are.

Authorizatoin is simply **What the user is permitted to do**. This means that we can restrict certain functionalities of our application to specific users or user groups.
