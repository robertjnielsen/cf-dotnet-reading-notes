# Policies In .NET Core Identity

_Source: [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies?view=aspnetcore-2.1)_

Underneath the covers, role-based authorization and claims-based authorization use a requirement, a requirement handler, and a pre-configured policy. These building blocks support the expression of authorization evaluations in code. The result is a richer, reusable, testable authorization structure.

An authorization policy consists of one or more requirements. It's registered as part of the authorization service configuration, in the Startup.ConfigureServices method:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AtLeast21", policy =>
            policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
    });
}
```

In the preceding example, an "AtLeast21" policy is created. It has a single requirementâ€”that of a minimum age, which is supplied as a parameter to the requirement.
