## What Is A Schema?

[A schema is a blueprint of a database, that ensure optimal organization.](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-a-schema-in-a-database-1019262)

A database schema is a collection of metadata that is used to describe the relationships between various objects and information in a given database.

A schema can be used as a pseudo-template for a table, relation, or data-set to be implemented in a database. Some database environments even apply access permissions to objects at a schema level.

## How Is A Schema Different Than A Database?

Each database system / environment could potentially handle this question in a different way. For example:

- MySql states that _"a schema is synonymous with a database."_ A schema and a database are essentially the same thing here.
- Oracle states that certain objects can be stored inside a database, but not inside a schema. Here, a schema and a database are different things.
- In SQL Server, a schema is a seperate entity inside the database, so again, two seperate things.

## Sooo?

What a schema exactly is, and how to use it depend on the database environment and DBMS that you are going to be utilizing. It is up to you to research the when and how for your environment.

Totally not helpful, huh?
